**NOTE:** This is a stub for the future cs198 API.

## Running the dev server

```bash
$ rails server
```

## Building

This runs tests and lint, to ensure that your code meets [quality
standards](https://github.com/cs198/cs198-api/wiki/contributing#code-quality-standards). This does
not, however, check if you have written tests in the first place!

```bash
$ rake
```

To run tests or lint in isolation, do:

```bash
$ rake test
$ rake lint
```

## Contribution guidelines

We use the [Github PR
workflow](https://github.com/cs198/cs198-api/wiki/contributing#how-to-contribute) to manage
